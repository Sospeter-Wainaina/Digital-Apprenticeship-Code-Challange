Consider a dataset providing information on the functionality of infrastructure resources,
for each water point it includes the name of the village it is in and its functional state.
Implement a data processing module in python which takes a dataset URL as input and
returns:

		● The number of water points that are functional,
		● The number of water points per community,
		● The rank for each community by the percentage of broken water points.
with the following structure:
   {
	number_functional: …,
	number_water_points: {
	communityA: …,
	},
	community_ranking: …
	}
I compiled all thesetasks into one function url_checker which returned all the required information.
Was amazing taking part in the coding challenge.
